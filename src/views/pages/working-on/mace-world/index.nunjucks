  <h2 id="learnings">Key takeaways</h2>
  <h3>Managing waiting/loading time experiences is trickier than it sounds!</h3>
    <p>My main learning was that you can build a custom Umbraco site from scratch in a week! Having worked at agencies where just the build can take 4 - 6 weeks, it was great to see the impact of having UX and design/development sit together and focus on iteratively working on a project.</p>
  <h3>Be considerate to your user</h3>
    <p>- Not having sound auto play
  - Not forving them to play video
  - Providing a quick alternative way for employees to access project detail - e.g salespeople on the road</p>
  <h3>Relationship management matters</h3>
    <p>Managing internal relationships and compromise
  MI, dev, design & ux - noone wants to compromise, keeping the experience good without compromising key values</p>
